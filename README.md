# Northwind

This is a simple CRUD application for managing the Employees in a standard Northwind database.

The application interfaces with a [REST service hosted via Express in Node.js](https://github.com/bhaeussermann/northwind-api).

It connects to where the API is hosted [here](https://northwind-api.onrender.com/swagger/) by default, but this can be changed 
in `routes.js`.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

## Dev server
```
npm start
```

The application will be hosted from `http://localhost:3000/`.
